\TEX\ is not an easy to learn typesetting system or program.
The problem is that \quotation {knowing everything is possible}
leads to \quotation {wanting everything that is possible}.
However using \CONTEXT\ or \TEX\ takes considerable learning
time. And it is not feasible to explain every single detail
in this manual. Therefore \quotation {doing} is the answer.
