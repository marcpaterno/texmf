# texmf

Marc's (local) texmf directory.

To use this, clone the repository and put in wherever your "local"
`texmf` directory should be. On a Mac, this will be
`$HOME/Library/texmf`. On a Linux machine, this will be `$HOME/texmf`.

Of interest to my colleagues at Fermilab is the Beamer template style
`beamerthemeMFP.sty`. This is my attempt to match the Fermilab
"official" PowerPoint and Keynote templates in Beamer. Any
improvements are welcome. Please fork this repository and send me pull
requests.
